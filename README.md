Money Flow

Money Flow is a lightweight World of Warcraft addon that tracks gold income and expenses per session.

It shows how much gold you have earned, spent, and your net balance since the last reset, presented in a clean and movable window that matches the default WoW UI. The addon updates automatically when your gold changes and supports manual resets via a button or slash command.

Money Flow is designed to be simple, transparent, and reliable — showing exactly what happens to your gold during a play session, nothing more.
